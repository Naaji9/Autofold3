# Protein Prediction Automation

This project is a web-based application that automates the process of protein structure prediction using AlphaFold 3. It allows users to upload their protein datasets, enter their credentials, and track the automation process step-by-step through a streamlined frontend interface.

## Features

- **Automated Protein Prediction**: Uses AlphaFold 3 to predict protein structures from input sequences.
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Users can see step-by-step feedback on the automation process.
- **Simple Frontend Interface**: A user-friendly React interface for easy data submission and status tracking.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Credentials are securely managed without persistent storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST framework
- **Automation**: Selenium, Python
- **Other Libraries**: Pandas for data processing, Gemmi for CIF to PDB conversion

## Installation

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/protein-prediction-automation.git
   cd protein-prediction-automation
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install django djangorestframework selenium pandas gemmi openpyxl
   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the Django server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the React app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter your email, password, and upload the `proteins.xlsx` file.
3. Click **Submit** to start the automation process.
4. Track the progress through real-time status updates on the frontend.

## Project Notes

- Ensure `chromedriver` is correctly installed as it’s used by Selenium for automation.
- The project is configured for local development. Make sure the backend and frontend are running on compatible local ports.
